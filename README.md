# OnlinePresenceMon
IDM Online Presence Monitoring repo is dedicated to host a set of tests for the collection of website, web applications and other digital platfoms maintained by IDM.

Our online ecosystem encompasses various websites, web platforms, and digital tools that we maintain and make available to the public, partners, and stakeholders. This includes our main website, subdomains, specialized portals, interactive platforms, and any other online resources we provide to engage with our audiences, share information, and support our mission and initiatives.

The goal for each test is to make sure that the critical path use case is properly working, and in an event of a failure, a notification is sent to  support@idmod.org (or any other appointed owner) automatically.

# Folder Structure
