# OnlinePresenceMon
IDM Online Presence Monitoring repo is dedicated to host a set of tests for the collection of website, web applications and other digital platfoms maintained by IDM.

Our online ecosystem encompasses various websites, web platforms, and digital tools that we maintain and make available to the public, partners, and stakeholders. This includes our main website, subdomains, specialized portals, interactive platforms, and any other online resources we provide to engage with our audiences, share information, and support our mission and initiatives.

For each test, the objective is to verify the proper functionality of the critical path use case. In the event of a failure, the test will collect logs and automatically draft, open, and assign a GitHub Issue. Additionally, a notification will be sent to support@idmod.org or any other designated owner. If a bug for the same test already exists, it won't create a new one.
